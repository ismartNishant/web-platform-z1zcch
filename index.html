                  By signing the Inflation Reduction Act, President Biden is delivering on his promise to build an economy
                  that works
                  for working families, including Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AA and NHPI)
                  families. The
                  Inflation Reduction Act lowers prescription drug costs, health care costs, and energy costs. It’s the
                  most aggressive
                  action we have taken to confront the climate crisis. It’ll lower the deficit and ask the super wealthy
                  and corporations
                  to pay their fair share. And no one making under $400,000 per year will pay a penny more in taxes. </p>
                  
                  <p> President Biden and Congressional Democrats beat back the special interests to pass this historic
                      legislation that lowers costs for Americans and their families, advances environmental justice while
                      building a cleaner future, and grows the economy from the bottom up and the middle out.</p>

              <h6 class=" text-decoration-underline">LOWER HEALTH CARE COSTS</h6>
              <p>The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will lower health care costs, including prescription drug costs,
                  and expand health insurance coverage for AA and NHPI families.
              </p>
              <p><span class="fw-bolder">Lower Prescription Drug Costs for Seniors:</span> Americans pay 2-3 times more for their
                  prescription drugs
                  than people in other wealthy countries. Nearly  <span class="america">1 in 4 Americans </span> struggle to afford prescription
                  drugs,
                  and high prices contribute to racial and ethnic health inequities. The Inflation Reduction Act will
                  help
                  close the gap in access to medication by improving prescription drug coverage and lowering drug
                  prices
                  in
                  Medicare. The law:
              </p>
              <ul>
                  <li> the amount that seniors will have to pay for prescription drugs they buy at the pharmacy at
                      $2,000 a year,
                      giving peace of mind to seniors who no longer have to worry about spending thousands and
                      thousands more on
                      prescription drugs.
                  </li>
                  <li>Caps the amount that seniors will have to pay for insulin at $35 for a month’s supply. </li>
                  <li>Provides access to a number of additional free vaccines, including the shingles vaccine, for
                      Medicare beneficiaries.</li>

              <h6 class=" text-decoration-underline" >MAKE THE TAX CODE FAIRER</h6>
              <p>President Trump and Congressional Republicans’ 2017 tax law only made an unfair tax system worse. The
                  Inflation Reduction Act
                  of 2022 is a critical step forward in making our tax code fairer. It will raise revenue by:</p>
              <div>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Ensuring that high-income people and large corporations pay the taxes they already owe.</li>
                      <li>Cracking down on large, profitable corporations that currently get away with paying no
                          federal
                          income tax. </li>
                      <li>Imposing a 1% surcharge on corporate stock buybacks that will encourage businesses to invest
                      </li>
                  </ul>
              </div>
              <p>
                  The legislation’s tax reforms won’t just raise revenue to finance critically needed investments to
                  lower costs and combat climate change, they are also an important component of building an economy
                  that
                  rewards work rather than wealth and doesn’t let the rich and powerful get away with playing by a
                  separate
                  set of rules.</p>

              <p> Millions of working families will have better access to the benefits they are entitled to
                  under the tax code and be able to get their questions answered quickly and efficiently, thanks
                  to the Act’s transformational investments in the Internal Revenue Service. And, no family making
                  less than $400,000 per year will see their taxes go up by a single cent.
